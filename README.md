## admin-template-starter:
A Backend Authority Management Framework

---

**admin-template-starter** is a full-fledged backend authority
management system framework, integrated with Spring Boot 2.x.x,
AdminLTE v3.2.0, Bootstrap 4.6.1, and Shiro 1.13.

This framework is designed to offer a plug-and-play solution.
With just a little configuration, it can be smoothly integrated
into your current projects, aiding in the swift setup of robust,
efficient, and visually appealing backend administration interfaces.

To achieve a high level of separation between the framework and
business logic, **admin-template-starter** encapsulates the
framework's core code into a Spring Boot Starter. Thus, it largely
hides the framework's intricacies, not only streamlining the
project structure but also significantly easing the tasks of daily
development and maintenance. Regardless of whether you are a novice
or a seasoned developer, you can effortlessly get started and
concentrate on crafting your business logic, without needing to
delve too deeply into the underlying technical details.
